# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | There is a perceived inadequacy with teachers in favoritism and in unequal mark distribution.| Data will be collected from each student's marks and also their marks on an internationally (or larger region) marked performance. Each teacher can be evaluated based on unstructured data stemming from student feedback of a teacher.| Some kind of inflation/deflation variable can be pulled from the given marks, pulled from school databases, in addition to their own identification pulled from this source.| The end goal with this data is to create an index of mark inequality/inflation/deflation between a teacher's given marks and the global consensus mark given internationally, and create some correlation between favoritism and mark inflation/deflation. This data can allow students or teachers to evaluate the impact of a teacher's favoritism on a student's learning and thus change their perspective on this subject matter.|
| Vaccination | The problem is that people tend to not take vaccines out of fear for their unreliability, especially when they are new. The goal is to evaluate the validity of such fears. | We should collect data that connects date after 1st release of vaccinations, and the other variable would be their condition after a set amount of weeks. | We can track IDs from government data and require the current data on past and future medical conditions, and simplify it to any relevant conditions regarding improvement or decline in medical conditions, and associate that information with the identification of the subject, and also correlate with the date at which they received their vaccination. | End goal is to publish such data in a journal |
| Productivity | I get too distracted at times on minor topics and end up sidetracking too much, so something needs to be designed to catch myself sidetracking.| I need to collect data based on times where I am making efforts in focusing on my work. I also need to collect data based on which apps or websites that I click off on when I get distracted.| Data can include the specific apps/websites that I work/get distracted on, and compile it into a list. I also need to track the specific times in which I need to focus. | The end goal is to use an app that uses this data to predict where and when I am sidetracking, and give a reminder to return back on topic.|

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
