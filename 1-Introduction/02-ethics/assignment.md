## Write A Data Ethics Case Study

## Instructions

You've learned about various [Data Ethics Challenges](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) and seen some examples of [Case Studies](README.md#3-case-studies) reflecting data ethics challenges in real-world contexts.

In this assignment, you'll write your own case study reflecting a data ethics challenge from your own experience, or from a relevant real-world context you are familiar with. Just follow these steps:

1. `Pick a Data Ethics Challenge`. Look at [the lesson examples](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) or explore online examples like [the Deon Checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) to get inspiration.

2. `Describe a Real World Example`. Think about a situation you have heard of (headlines, research study etc.) or experienced (local community), where this specific challenge occurred. Think about the data ethics questions related to the challenge - and discuss the potential harms or unintended consequences that arise because of this issue. Bonus points: think about potential solutions or processes that may be applied here to help eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact of this challenge.

3. `Provide a Related Resources list`. Share one or more resources (links to an article, a personal blog post or image, online research paper etc.) to prove this was a real-world occurrence. Bonus points: share resources that also showcase the potential harms & consequences from the incident, or highlight positive steps taken to prevent its recurrence.

# Case Study Example: Cambridge Analytica Scandal
What Happened? | Data Ethics Issues Involved | Consequences |
--- | --- | -- | 
On Facebook in the 2010s, an app "This Is Your Digital Life" by Cambridge Analytica was created to survey several Facebook users. Facebook, however, also allowed the app to collect personal information from respondents and also those from their friends. This resulted in mass data collection without consent that was used in political campaigns by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. | `Data Ownership: ` What rights did Cambridge Analytica have with the usage of the personal data of Facebook users? Was it responsible for this data to be used in a political campaign? <br/><br/>`Informed Consent: ` Did users understand that their personal information was also being used for political purposes, and beyond academic ones? Did the friends of survey respondents know their personal information was being used? <br/><br/> `Data Privacy: ` Are users' personal information being protected when shared with political campaigns? Can users ensure that their information is protected when it is shared with an unknown third party? | 1. Losing trust in social media institutions such as Facebook to protect their personal data. <br/><br/>2. Many users' data has been leaked to a separate organization in which these users are unsure of the security of their data in the hands of the separate party.<br/><br/>3. There are risks of misuse of personal data as users are unaware of how their data will be used by the unmentioned third party.|

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One or more data ethics challenges are identified. <br/> <br/> The case study clearly describes a real-world incident reflecting that challenge, and highlights undesirable consequences or harms it caused. <br/><br/> There is at least one linked resource to prove this occurred. | One data ethics challenge is identified. <br/><br/> At least one relevant harm or consequence is discussed briefly. <br/><br/> However discussion is limited or lacks proof of real-world occurence. | A data challenge is identified. <br/><br/> However the description or resources do not adequately reflect the challenge or prove it's real-world occurence. |
